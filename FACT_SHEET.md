Game Fact Sheet

Working Title

(TBD) — Dark satirical survival RPG

⸻

One‑Sentence Pitch

A darkly satirical survival RPG, inspired by Oregon Trail and Papers, Please, where players manage a family navigating modern U.S. cities under escalating immigration enforcement, learning their rights and the cost of asserting them through systemic, not tactical, play.

⸻

Design Intent (Non‑Negotiables)
	•	Satire punches up at systems, bureaucracy, and power — never at victims.
	•	Educational, not instructional: the game teaches rights, tradeoffs, and structures, not real‑world evasion tactics.
	•	Winnable: survival, sanctuary, or transformation are possible outcomes.
	•	Systemic framing: failure feels political and structural, not personal.
	•	Opacity by design: players experience consequences before causes.

⸻

Player Fantasy

“I am trying to keep my family together while invisible forces quietly turn everyday life into risk — and I must decide when to endure, when to assert my rights, and when to resist, knowing every choice has consequences.”

⸻

Genre & Tone
	•	Genre: Narrative survival RPG
	•	Perspective: Strategic / turn‑based, non‑tactical
	•	Tone: Dark satire with emotional weight
	•	Comparable Titles:
	•	Papers, Please
	•	This War of Mine
	•	Disco Elysium
	•	Night in the Woods

⸻

Setting
	•	Time: Near‑future United States (circa 2026)
	•	Place: Real U.S. cities and real neighborhoods (abstracted)
	•	Scope: One city at a time, with 3–6 playable neighborhoods

The game models real‑world plausibility, not literal simulation.

⸻

Core Gameplay Loop

Each turn (day or week):
	1.	Plan — allocate family effort (work, care, advocacy, rest)
	2.	Pulse Update — global, city, and neighborhood states drift
	3.	Event — systemic or local shock occurs
	4.	Decision — values‑based choice (assert, comply, delay, sacrifice)
	5.	Consequence — shifts in risk, trust, stress, and narrative state

⸻

World Model (Authoritative)

The world operates through nested pressure systems:

Global / National
        ↓
      City
        ↓
  Neighborhood
        ↓
     Family (interface only)

	•	Global sets the political weather
	•	Cities interpret and translate pressure
	•	Neighborhoods express consequences
	•	Family absorbs impact and responds

⸻

Key Systems

Pulses

Slow‑moving state variables at each layer (global, city, neighborhood).

Events

Discrete shocks that temporarily or permanently re‑weight pulses.

Rights Knowledge

Abstracted as dialogue options and modifiers (never step‑by‑step tactics).

Trust Networks

Community strength that provides warnings, aid, and recovery capacity.

Visibility

A central risk vector influenced by identity, behavior, and context.

⸻

Family Interface (Impact Only)

The family influences the world indirectly through four variables:
	•	Visibility — how noticeable the family is
	•	Stress — accumulated psychological pressure
	•	Cohesion — ability to act together
	•	Trust Network Strength — community support

No individual family stats are defined at this stage.

⸻

Difficulty & Commentary
	•	Difficulty scales structurally, not mechanically.
	•	Identity factors (e.g., skin tone, religion) act as multipliers on existing systems, not separate rule sets.
	•	The UI never explicitly labels discrimination; it manifests as probability shifts and reduced margins.

⸻

Victory Conditions

Players can win in multiple ways:
	1.	Sanctuary — build enough local protection that enforcement recedes
	2.	Outlast — survive until political conditions change
	3.	Transform — force institutional retreat through exposure and pressure

Failure is possible, but never trivialized.

⸻

What the Game Is NOT
	•	Not a tactical stealth game
	•	Not a real‑world how‑to guide
	•	Not a power fantasy
	•	Not morally neutral about systems of harm

⸻

Ethical Guardrails
	•	Fictionalized events grounded in historical precedent
	•	Clear disclaimer separating gameplay abstraction from real‑world advice
	•	No explicit procedural instructions for evasion or illegal activity
	•	Trauma handled with restraint and implication, not spectacle

Summary

This game explores how modern bureaucratic power transforms ordinary life into risk — and asks whether survival, solidarity, and dignity are still possible inside that system.
