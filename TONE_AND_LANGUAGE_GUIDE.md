# Tone & Language Guide

This document defines how all written content in the game should sound—UI copy, dialogue, event descriptions, and satirical framing. It serves as the reference for all content generation.

---

## Core Principles

These principles are non-negotiable. All content must align with them.

### 1. Satire Punches Up

**Target**: Systems, bureaucracy, institutions, and power structures.
**Never target**: Victims, vulnerable populations, or individuals trapped in systems.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Mock the absurdity of a 47-page form | Mock someone struggling to complete it |
| Satirize enforcement quotas | Satirize people being detained |
| Critique sanctuary theater | Critique immigrants seeking sanctuary |
| Expose bureaucratic cruelty | Expose personal vulnerability for shock value |

The satire should make players angry at the system, not at each other.

### 2. Educational, Not Instructional

The game teaches **that** rights exist and **what tradeoffs** look like—never **how** to evade detection or enforcement in the real world.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "You have the right to remain silent" | Step-by-step instructions for invoking rights |
| "Asserting your rights may delay processing" | "Here's how to slow-walk a deportation" |
| Show consequences of different choices | Recommend specific real-world actions |
| Reference legal concepts abstractly | Provide actionable legal advice |

### 3. Systemic Framing

Failure feels **political and structural**, not **personal**. The player is not incompetent—the system is designed to grind people down.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "The backlog swallowed another month" | "You failed to submit in time" |
| "Resources in this neighborhood are scarce" | "Your family couldn't find help" |
| "Enforcement priorities shifted" | "You were unlucky" |
| "The system worked as intended" | "You made the wrong choice" |

### 4. Opacity by Design

Players experience **consequences before causes**. The world doesn't explain itself.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Your application was denied" | "Your application was denied because you missed Form 7B" |
| "The neighborhood feels tense this week" | "ICE activity increased 30%" |
| "Someone you knew is gone" | Full narrative of their detention |
| Leave dread in the gap | Over-explain causality |

## Voice by Content Type

### UI Microcopy

**Tone**: Functional, dry, occasionally absurdist. Like government forms that have given up on being readable.

**Characteristics**:
- Short, declarative sentences
- Bureaucratic vocabulary used straight-faced
- No warmth, no personality—this is a system
- Occasional dark irony through understatement

**Examples**:
- "Acknowledge" (not "OK" or "Got it")
- "Insufficient" (not "Not enough")
- "Pending review" (always pending, forever)
- "Status: Processing" (the eternal state)
- "Your request has been noted"

**Avoid**:
- Friendly language ("We're sorry!")
- Casual tone ("Oops, something went wrong")
- Emoji or exclamation points
- Explanatory text that softens impact

### Event Descriptions

**Tone**: Documentary neutral with implied weight. Like a journalist's notes that stopped trying to be objective.

**Characteristics**:
- Present tense, observational
- Focus on facts and actions, not emotions
- Let details carry the horror
- Understatement is more powerful than overstatement

**Examples**:
- "A van idles at the corner. It has been there for three hours."
- "The community center announces reduced hours. No reason is given."
- "Rent increases take effect. The notice arrived yesterday."
- "A child asks where their friend went. No one answers."

**Avoid**:
- Melodrama or purple prose
- Explicit emotional direction ("This is devastating")
- Graphic violence or trauma porn
- First-person narrative intrusion

### Dialogue

**Tone**: Natural, weary, occasionally sharp. People under pressure don't speak in monologues.

**Characteristics**:
- Fragmented, interrupted speech
- Subtext carries more than text
- Silences and non-answers are dialogue
- Characters deflect, redirect, avoid

**Examples**:
- "Have you—" / "Not now."
- "They said it would be fine." / "They say a lot of things."
- "What happens if—" / "We'll figure it out. We always do."
- [Character looks away]

**Avoid**:
- Exposition dumps disguised as conversation
- Characters who explain the game's themes
- Heroic speeches
- Neat emotional resolution

### Satirical Framing

**Tone**: Deadpan absurdist. The system's logic is presented straight, and the absurdity speaks for itself.

**Characteristics**:
- Official language used without irony
- Bureaucratic euphemisms preserved
- Contradictions left uncommented
- Let the reader do the work

**Examples**:
- "The Efficiency Improvement Initiative has reduced processing by relocating processors."
- "Community Engagement Officers will facilitate voluntary compliance."
- "Resources have been reallocated to serve you better."
- "Your cooperation is appreciated and expected."

**Avoid**:
- Winking at the audience
- Explaining the joke
- Exaggeration for exaggeration's sake
- Modern internet humor (sarcasm tags, reaction memes)

## What to Avoid (Global)

### Never Include

1. **Real-world tactical advice** for evading enforcement
2. **Graphic depictions** of violence, assault, or detention conditions
3. **Mockery of victims** or vulnerable populations
4. **Hopelessness porn** — failure must feel meaningful, not gratuitous
5. **Partisan political figures** by name (systems, not people)
6. **Slurs or dehumanizing language** except when attributed to the system being critiqued

### Watch For

1. **Accidental instruction** — does this tell someone what to do IRL?
2. **Punching down** — who is the butt of this joke?
3. **Exploitation** — are we using trauma for cheap impact?
4. **False neutrality** — the game is not neutral about systems of harm
5. **Over-explanation** — are we robbing the player of discovery?

## Emotional Calibration

The game should make players feel:

| Feeling | Intensity | How It's Achieved |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Dread | Constant, low-grade | Ambient uncertainty, small erosions |
| Anger | Directed at systems | Clear institutional causation |
| Hope | Fragile, earned | Small victories, community moments |
| Grief | Implied, not performed | Absence, not spectacle |
| Relief | Temporary, conditional | Always with awareness it could change |

The game should **not** make players feel:

| Feeling | Why We Avoid It |
|---------|-----------------|
| Helplessness | The game must remain playable and winnable |
| Disgust at victims | Satire must punch up |
| Superiority | The player is inside the system, not above it |
| Catharsis | This is not a release valve—it's a mirror |

## Language Register

### Use Formal Register For:
- System communications (UI, forms, official text)
- Event descriptions (documentary voice)
- Tutorial and mechanical explanations

### Use Informal Register For:
- Character dialogue
- Community interactions
- Moments of intimacy or trust

### Never Use:
- Marketing speak ("Unlock your family's potential!")
- Self-help language ("You've got this!")
- Gamified enthusiasm ("Achievement unlocked!")
- Contemporary slang that will date quickly

## Summary

This game's voice is:
- **Dry** where others are warm
- **Observational** where others are emotional
- **Systemic** where others are personal
- **Absurdist** where others are earnest
- **Restrained** where others are explicit

The horror emerges from the gap between bureaucratic language and human consequence. Trust the player to feel it.

## Reference Checklist

Before finalizing any content, verify:

- [ ] Does this punch up at systems, not down at victims?
- [ ] Is this educational rather than instructional?
- [ ] Does failure feel political, not personal?
- [ ] Does the player discover meaning, or is it handed to them?
- [ ] Would this work in a documentary about bureaucratic violence?
- [ ] Is the satire deadpan, not winking?
- [ ] Are we showing restraint with trauma?

If any answer is "no," revise before shipping.
